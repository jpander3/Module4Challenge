#Project Title
Module4Challenge - PyCity Schools Analysis - Pandas Challenge

#Project Description
PyCity has provided us with data about each of the students and schools within the school district. The school data that have been provided includes School ID, School Name, School Type, School Budget, and School Size (number of students). Student Data that has been provided includes Student ID, Student Name, Gender, Grade, School Name, Reading Score, and Math Score. We have been asked to modify the data in order to create data frames that help deduce conclusions about the school system or district. The first data frame that is created gives information about all totals and averages for the whole district. The next data frame shows information about totals and averages for each school. After breaking down the data per school, the data frame will be reorganized to show the five schools that had the highest and lowest overall passing percentages. The school district would also like to know how each school did in math and reading compared to grade levels. A data frame has been created to show how the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders did at each school within the school system. Spending is always important so the district would also like each school to be categorized by the budget for each student at each school. The four ranges included less than $585, between $585 and $630, between $630 and $645, and between $645 and $680. A data frame is created to show the average scores and percentages for each spending range. School size is the next attribute that is categorized and just like for spending ranges, each school has been categorized as either large, medium, or small. A data frame is created to show the average scores and percentages per each school size. Lastly, the school district would like to compare school types, either charter or district (public) schools. The final data frame is created to show the average scores and percentages for charter schools and district schools.

#Getting Started
If a school system would like to use this code they would need to provide Student Data and School Data in csv files.
Student Data should include Student ID, Student Name, Gender, Grade, School Name, Reading Score, and Math Score.
School Data should include School ID, School Name, School Type, School Budget, School Size(number of students).
